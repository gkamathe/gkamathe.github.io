<h3>Awesome Title </h3>
<p>Hello again privateers!</p>
<p>It's been an exciting few weeks in the world of privacy, and for the book, which is now out on Kindle/eBook and soon arriving in Europe! I posted <a href="https://twitter.com/kjam/status/1653738931706294279">a short video reviewing what you can read online for free for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p>This issue will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta's Mega-fine (1.2Bâ‚¬/$1.3B) for violation of GDPR rules</li>

</ul>

<h3 class="align-center">Title Goes here</h3>
<p>Last week, the Irish data protection authorities issued Meta a 1BÂ£ / 1.2Bâ‚¬ / $1.3B fine for violation of GDPR for transferring large quantities of personal data from European residents to the US. This is in direct violation of the invalidation of the US-EU Privacy Shield, which I covered in <a href="https://probablyprivate.com/issue/welcome-privacy-shield-contract-tracing-adversarial-ml/">my first ever newsletter</a>. </p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If you collect data in Europe and send it to the US, run a risk analysis with your team on the sensitivity of the data and flows. Determine if you'd like to mitigate risks now and how to prioritize the found risks. If you cannot yet answer these questions, it's time to invest in your data governance plan to appropriately document your current data and more easily identify risk.</p>
</li>

</ol>
<p>These conversations were quite inspiring; I want to thank the organizers at <a href="https://www.ethicalalliance.co/">Ethical Alliance</a> and <a href="https://empathy.co/">Empathy</a>. If you've never attended a conference focused on ethics or privacy, I can recommend it! It's wonderful to start the conversation from a shared understanding and set of values, and see where it goes from there.</p>
<h3 class="align-center">Upcoming Speaking Events: May and June 2023</h3>
<p>Conferences are back in full-effect! ðŸŽŠ Here's where I'll be in the next few weeks.</p>
<ul>

<li><em>Coming Soon</em>: "What is Privacy Engineering?" Video Series with privacy engineers, stay tuned!</li>
</ul>
<p>Please drop me a line or come say hi if you'll be in attendance. I'll be sending updates in future newsletters and on social media, in case you want to follow along.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at an upcoming event (online or in-person), and am excited to hear any and all feedback about the book. If you want to post a review on LinkedIn or other socials and tag me, I will be happy to re-share. ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>In terms of upcoming newsletters, here is a backlog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a personalized RSS reader &amp; recommender</li>
<li>Internet Privacy Primer</li>
